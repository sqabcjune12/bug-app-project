# Bug App Project
## Application which logs bugs into the system

*Application that registers bugs into the system (new repository: bug-app-project). The application should first ask how many bugs should be entered into the system. Then the system should perform a loop asking for all bug details storing them into individual arrays (make sure to initialize all arrays to the retrieved size). Bug details include: bugId (int), reporterName, bugName, bugCategory(char), operatingSystem, date, bugDetails, frequency (double), isActive (boolean). Finally the system should display all bug details before exiting.*

*(As an advanced feature, ArrayList collection type can be implemented instead of arrays. Adding options for the user to add a bug and remove a bug. This is achieved by using multiple ArrayList's or one ArrayList containing a class of type Bug - either ArrayList<Integer>, ArrayList<String>, ArrayList<String>, ect for all types of details OR one ArrayList<Bug> given you create a class for Bug.*
